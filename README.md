To use, replace the "https://example.foo/bar" in send_slack_message() with whatever endpoint you want JSON sent to- for slack that'll be the incoming webhook url. If your slack doesn't have an Incoming Webhook integration for this, https://api.slack.com/messaging/webhooks is a handy guide to setting one up, whereas if someone else has set up an integration on your slack for this and you just want to be able to send to it as well, you can access it via Customize Slack -> Menu -> Configure Apps. If you want to configure a webhook for your discord, https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/228383668-Intro-to-Webhooks . The messages are configured based on slack's text formatting, so there might be some slight weirdness on discord (missing emoji, etc).
