# webliero_stat_recorder
Browser script for recording scores in webliero games

Currently exists in two forms: recorder.js (the script) and bookmarklet (a URI-escaped single-line version of the script that can be run as a bookmarklet in browser or simply pasted into the url field of your browser).

I don't yet have a script written to dynamically generate the bookmarklet, unfortunately- I'm using the generator at https://mrcoles.com/bookmarklet/ at this time.
